# 📱 Project Stimulation
This game is about someone finding an iPhone and connecting it to the internet. By doing so, several messages from some time ago are uncovered. By unlocking the phone many dark secrets are unravelled.

## ⏳ Project State 
I'm currently still in the process of developing this application.

## 🎨 Project Design
The first part of this project was coming up with the ideas, and vizualizing these into designs. I have used Figma to create some [designs for the start of the application](https://www.figma.com/file/5cUDRsdjkNI6INtO4RWnxD/Level-8?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=IbwTieA5qimvpOyC-1). This is still ongoing, so more will be added.

## 🔮 Project Plans
- More apps on the home screen
- Chat with a strange person
- Finish up the story-line
